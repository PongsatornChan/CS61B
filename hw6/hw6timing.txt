My ECHashStringSet behaves roughly linear.

2c. Does your **BST**StringSet look roughly linear or roughly
quadratic in its scaling behavior for in order strings?
- My BSTStringSet looks linear although it took significantly longer.


Before submitting, make sure that your ECHashStringSet is capable of
handling inputs of size 1000000 in a reasonable amount of time (a few
seconds).
- I surprised, it did pretty well.
